# Foreword {#foreword}

*Essential Play* is aimed at beginner-to-intermediate Scala developers who want to get started using the [Play 2](link-play) web framework. By the end of the course we will have a solid foundation in each of the main libraries Play provides for building sites and services:

 - Routing, controllers, and actions
 - Manipulating requests and responses
 - Generating HTML
 - Parsing and validating form data
 - Reading and writing JSON
 - Asynchronous request handling
 - Calling external web services

As coursework we will build a simple chat application from the ground up. We will start with a very basic web site and end up building a complete service-oriented architecture with each concern separated out to a separate microservice.

The material presented focuses on Play version 2.3, although the approaches introduced are generally applicable to Play 2.2+.
