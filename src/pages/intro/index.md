# Introduction

*Essential Slick* is aimed at beginner-to-intermediate Scala developers who want to get started using the [Slick][link-slick] framework.

Slick is a Scala library for working with databases: querying, inserting data, updating data, and representing a schema.  Queries are written in Scala and type checked by the compiler. Slick aims to make working with a database similar to working with regular Scala collections.

This material is aimed at a Scala developer who has:

* taken the [Essential Scala][link-essential-scala] course or equivalent;
* a good understanding of relation databases (rows, columns, joins, indexes) and SQL;
* access to a relational database; and
* JDK 7 installed, along with an editor or IDE (Scala IDE for Eclipse, or IntelliJ).

The material presented focuses on Slick version 2.0.3, examples use [Postgres][link-postgres] as the relational database.

Many thanks to [Jonathan Ferguson][link-twitter-jono] and the team at [Underscore][link-underscore] for their invaluable contributions and proof reading.
