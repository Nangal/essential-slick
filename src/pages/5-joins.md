# Joins and Aggregates {#joins}

Wrangling data with [joins][link-wikipedia-joins] and aggregates can be painful.  In this chapter we'll try to ease that pain by exploring:

* different styles of join (monadic and applicative);
* different ways to join (inner, outer and zip); and
* aggregate functions and grouping.

<div class="callout callout-info">
Joins have changed in Slick 3. Out are _Implicit_ and _Explicit_ joins, in are _Applicative_ and _Monadic_ joins.

If you are new to Slick, don't worry about _Implicit_ and _Explicit_ joins - less to forget.

If you are familar with _Implicit_ and _Explicit_ joins, _Applicative_ use _Explicit_ joins under the hood and _Monadic_ use _Implicit_ joins - This might change in the future versions of Slick.

</div>


## Monadic Joins

We have seen an example of monadic joins in the last chapter:

~~~ scala
val q = for {
  msg <- messages
  usr <- msg.sender
} yield (usr.name, msg.content)
~~~

Notice how we are using `msg.sender` which is defined as a foreign key:

``` scala
def sender = foreignKey("msg_sender_fk", senderId, users)(_.id)
```

Slick generates something like the following SQL:

``` sql
select
  u."name", m."content"
from
  "message" m, "user" u
where
  u."id" = m."sender"
```

That's the monadic style of query, using foreign key relations.

<div class="callout callout-info">
**Run the Code**

You'll find the example queries for this section in the file _joins.sql_ over at [the associated GitHub repository][link-example].

From the _chapter-05_ folder, start SBT and at the SBT `>` prompt run:

~~~
runMain JoinsExample
~~~
</div>


We can also rewrite the query to control the table relationships ourselves:

~~~ scala
val q = for {
  msg <- messages
  usr <- users
  if usr.id === msg.senderId
} yield (usr.name, msg.content)
~~~

Note how this time we're using `msg.senderId`, not the foreign key `sender`. This produces the same query when we joined using `sender`.

<div class="callout callout-warning">
Monadic joins allow for the right-hand-side to depend on the left-hand side, which is not possible in SQL.
If Slick is unable to compile them into applicative joins a runtime error will occur.
</div>

**TODO: Can we create an example to show the above failing?**


## Applicative Joins

An applicative join is where the join type is explicitly defined.
In SQL this is via the `JOIN` and `ON` keywords,
which is mirrored in Slick as the `join` and `on` methods.

Slick offers the following methods to join two or more tables:

  * `join`      --- an inner join,
  * `joinLeft`  --- a left outer join,
  * `joinRight` --- a right outer join,
  * `joinFull`  --- a full outer join.

As a quick taste of the syntax,
we can join the `messages` table to the `users` on the `senderId`:

``` scala
val q = messages join users on (_.senderId === _.id)
```

This will be a query of `(MessageTable, UserTable)`.
If we wanted to, we could be more explicit about the values used in the `on` part:

``` scala
val q = messages join users on
  ( (m: MessageTable, u: UserTable) =>  m.senderId === u.id)
```

...but it reads well without this.

In the rest of this section we'll work through a variety of more involved joins.
You may find it useful to refer to figure 5.1, which sketches the schema we're using in this chapter.


![The database schema for this chapter.  Find this code in the _chat-schema.scala_ file of the example project on GitHub.](src/img/Schema.png)



### Inner Join

An inner join is where we select records from multiple tables, where those records exist (in some sense) in all tables. We'll look at a chat example where we expect messages that have a sender in the user table, and a room in the rooms table:

```scala
val inner =
  messages.
  join(users).on(_.senderId === _.id).
  join(rooms).on{ case ((msg,user), room) => msg.roomId === room.id}

val query = for {
  dId <- daveId
  rId <- airLockId
  ((msgs, usrs), rms) <- inner
  if usrs.id === dId && rms.id === rId
} yield (msgs.content, usrs.name, rms.title)

val results = exec(query.result)
```

You might prefer to inline `inner` within the `query`. That's fine, but we've separated the parts out here to discuss them. And as queries in Slick compose, this works out nicely.

Let's start with the `inner` part. We're joining `messages` to `users`, and `messages` to `rooms`. We need two `join`s - if you are joining _n_ tables you'll need _n-1_ join expressions. Notice that the second `on` method call is given a tuple of `(MessageTable,UserTable)` and `RoomTable`.

We're using a pattern match to make this explicit, and that's the style we prefer.  However, you may see this more concisely expressed as:

``` scala
val inner =
  messages.
  join(users).on(_.senderId  === _.id).
  join(rooms).on(_._1.roomId === _.id)
```

Either way, when it comes to the `query` itself we're using pattern matching again to unpick the results of `inner`, and adding additional guard conditions (which will be a `WHERE` clause in SQL).

Finally, we mapping to the columns we want: content, user name, and room title.


### Left Join

A left join (a.k.a. left outer join), adds an extra twist. Now we are selecting all the records from a table, and matching records from another table _if they exist_, and if not we will have `NULL` values in the query result.

For an example of from our chat schema, observe that messages can optionally be sent privately to another user. So let's say we want a list of all the messages and who they were sent to.  Visually the left outer join is as shown in figure 5.2.

![A visualization of the left outer join example. Selecting messages and associated recipients (users). For similar diagrams, see [A Visual Explanation of SQL Joins][link-visual-joins], _Coding Horror_, 11 Oct 2007.](src/img/left-outer.png)

To implement this type of query we need to be aware of what columns are being returned, and if they can be `NULL` or not:

``` scala
val left = messages.
  joinLeft(users).on(_.toId === _.id).
  map { case (m, u) => (m.content, u.map(_.name)) }

exec(left.result).foreach(println)
```

We're producing a list of messages and the name of user they were sent to (if any).

The sample data we have in _joins.sql_ in the _chapter05_ folder contains just two private messages (between Frank and Dave).  The rest are public. So our query results are:

```
(Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?,             None)
(Affirmative, Dave. I read you.,               None)
(Open the pod bay doors, HAL.,                 None)
(I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that., None)
(Well, whaddya think?,                         None)
(I'm not sure, what do you think?,             None)
(Are you thinking what I'm thinking?,          Some(Dave))
(Maybe,                                        Some(Frank))
```


<div class="callout callout-info">
**NULLs in Joins**

Notice we need to map over the `u` to retrieve the name?
This because slick now wraps possibly null value in an `Option`.  So for those of you who are familiar with Slick 2.1, no more appending `.?` to possibly nullable columns.
</div>


### Right Join

In the left join we selected all the records from the left side of the join, with possibly `NULL` values from the other tables.
The right join (or right outer join) swaps this,
selecting all message from the table on the right side of the join.

We can switch the example for left join and ask for all users, what private messages have they received:

``` scala
val right = for {
  (msg, user) <- messages.joinRight(users).on(_.toId === _.id)
} yield (user.name, msg.map(_.content))

exec(right.result).foreach(println)
```

From the results this time we can see that just Dave and Frank have seen private messages:

```
(Dave,  Some(Are you thinking what I'm thinking?))
(HAL,   None)
(Elena, None)
(Frank, Some(Maybe))
```


### Full Outer Join

At the time of writing H2 does not support full outer joins.
Whereas earlier versions of Slick would throw a runtime exception,
Slick 3 compiles the query down to something that will run.

``` scala
val outer = for {
  (room, msg) <- rooms joinFull messages on (_.id === _.roomId)
} yield room.map(_.title) -> msg.map(_.content)
```

That would be the title of all rooms and messages in those rooms. Either side could be `NULL` because messages don't have to be in rooms, and rooms don't have to have any messages.

## Zip Joins

Zip joins are equivalent to `zip` on a Scala collection.  Recall that the `zip` in the collections library operates on two lists and returns a list of pairs:

``` scala
scala> val xs = List(1,2,3)

scala> xs zip xs.drop(1)
/// List[(Int, Int)] = List((1,2), (2,3))
```

Slick provides the equivalent for queries, plus two variations. Let's say we want to pair up adjacent messages into what we'll call a "conversation":

```scala
// Select messages, ordered by the date the messages were sent
val msgs = messages.sortBy(_.ts asc)

// Pair up adjacent messages:
val conversations = msgs zip msgs.drop(1)

// Select out just the contents of the first and second messages:
val zipQuery: List[(String,String)] =
  conversations.map { case (fst, snd) => fst.content -> snd.content }

exec(zipQuery.result).foreach(println)
```

This will turn into an inner join, producing output like:

```
(Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?, Affirmative, Dave. I read you.),
(Affirmative, Dave. I read you.  , Open the pod bay doors, HAL.),
(Open the pod bay doors, HAL.    , I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't  â†©
                                                                    do that.)
```

A second variation, `zipWith`, allows you to give a mapping function along with the join. We could have written the above as:

``` scala
def combiner(fst: MessageTable, snd: MessageTable) =
  fst.content -> snd.content

val query = msgs.zipWith(msgs.drop(1), combiner)
```

The final variant is `zipWithIndex`, which is as per the Scala collections method of the same name. Let's number each message:

``` scala
exec(messages.zipWithIndex.map {
  case (msg, index) => index -> msg.content
}.result).foreach(println)
```

The data from this query will start:

```
(0,Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?),
(1,Affirmative, Dave. I read you.),
(2,Open the pod bay doors, HAL.),
...
```


## Joins Summary

We've seen examples of the different kinds of join. You can also mix join types.
If you want to left join on a couple of tables, and then right join on something else, go ahead because Slick supports that.

We can also see different ways to construct the arguments to our `on` methods,
either deconstructing the tuple with pattern matching, or by referencing the tuple position with an underscore method,
e.g. `_1`. We would recommend using a case statement as it easier to read than walking the tuple.

The examples above show a join and each time we've used an `on` to constrain the join.  This is optional.  If you omit the `on` call, you end up with an implicit cross join (every row from the left table with every row from the right table).  For example:

~~~ scala
(messages leftJoin users).run.foreach(println)
~~~

Finally, we have shown examples of building queries using either for comprehension or maps and filters. You get to pick which style you prefer.


## Seen Any Scary Queries?

If you've been following along and running the example joins, you might have noticed large and unusual queries being generated.

An example is looking up the user's name and message content for each message:

~~~ scala
users.
  join(messages).
  on(_.id === _.senderId).
  map{ case (u,m) => u.name -> m.content }
~~~

The query we'd write by hand for this is:

~~~ sql
select
  "user".name, "message".content
from
  "user" inner join "message" on "user".id = "message".sender
~~~

Slick actually produces:

``` sql
select
  x2.x3, x4.x5
from
  (select x6."name" as x3, x6."id" as x7 from "user" x6) x2
inner join
  (select x8."content" as x5, x8."sender" as x9 from "message" x8) x4
on
  x2.x7 = x4.x9
```

That's not so bad, but it is a little strange. For more involved queries they can look much worse.
If Slick generates such verbose queries are they are going to be slow? Yes, sometimes they will be.

Here's the key concept: the SQL generated by Slick is fed to the database optimizer. That optimizer has far better knowledge about your database, indexes, query paths, than anything else.  It will optimize the SQL from Slick into something that works well.

Unfortunately, some optimizers don't manage this very well. Postgres does a good job. MySQL is, at the time of writing, pretty bad at this. You know the lesson here: measure, use your database tools to EXPLAIN the query plan, and adjust queries as necessary.  The ultimate adjustment of a query is to re-write it using _Plain SQL_. We will introduce Plain SQL in [Chapter 6](#PlainSQL).



## Aggregation

Aggregate functions are all about computing a single value from some set of rows. A simple example is `count`. This section looks at aggregation, and also at grouping rows, and computing values on those groups.

### Functions

Slick provides a few aggregate functions, as listed in the table below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Method           SQL
---------------  ---------------------------------------------------
 `length`        `COUNT(1)`

 `countDistinct` `COUNT(DISTINCT column)`

 `min`           `MIN(column)`

 `max`           `MAX(column)`

 `sum`           `SUM(column)`

 `avg`           `AVG(column)` --- mean of the column values
-----------      --------------------------------------------------

: A Selection of Aggregate Functions


Using them causes no great surprises, as shown in the following examples:

``` scala
val numRows = exec(messages.length.result)

val senders:Int = exec(messages.map(_.senderId).countDistinct.result)

val firstSent:Option[DateTime] = exec(messages.map(_.ts).min.result)
```

While `length` and `countDistinct` return an `Int`, the other functions return an `Option`. This is because there may be no rows returned by the query, meaning the is no minimum, maximum and so on.


### Grouping

You may find you use the aggregate functions with column grouping. For example, how many messages has each user sent?  Slick provides `groupBy` which will group rows by some expression. Here's an example:

``` scala
val msgPerUser =
  messages.groupBy(_.senderId).
  map { case (senderId, msgs) => senderId -> msgs.length }.
  result
```

That'll work, but it will be in terms of a user's primary key. It'd be nicer to see the user's name. We can do that using our join skills:

``` scala
val msgsPerUser =
   messages.join(users).on(_.senderId === _.id).
   groupBy { case (msg, user)  => user.name }.
   map     { case (name, group) => name -> group.length }.
   result
```

The results would be:

``` scala
Vector((Frank,2), (HAL,2), (Dave,4))
```

So what's happened here? What `groupBy` has given us is a way to place rows into groups, according to some function we supply. In this example, the function is to group rows based on the user's name. It doesn't have to be a `String`, it could be any type in the table.

When it comes to mapping, we now have the key to the group (the user's name in our case), and the corresponding group rows as a query.  Because we've joined messages and users, our group is a query of those two tables.  In this example we don't care what the query is because we're just counting the number of rows.  But sometimes we will need to know more about the query.


Let's look at a more involved example, by collecting some statistics about our messages. We want to find, for each user, how many messages they sent, and the date of their first message.  We want a result something like this:

```
Vector(
  (Frank, 2, Some(2001-02-16T20:55:00.000Z)),
  (HAL,   2, Some(2001-02-17T10:22:52.000Z)),
  (Dave,  4, Some(2001-02-16T20:55:04.000Z)))
```

We have all the aggregate functions we need to do this:

``` scala
val stats =
   messages.join(users).on(_.senderId === _.id).
   groupBy { case (msg, user) => user.name }.
   map     {
    case (name, group) =>
      (name, group.length, group.map{ case (msg, user) => msg.ts}.min)
   }
```

We've now started to create a bit of a monster query. We can simplify this, but before doing so, it may help to clarify that this query is equivalent to the following SQL:

``` sql
select
  user.name, count(1), min(message.ts)
from
  message inner join user on message.sender = user.id
group by
  user.name
```

Convince yourself the Slick and SQL queries are equivalent, by comparing:

* the `map` expression in the Slick query to the `SELECT` clause in the SQL;
* the `join` to the SQL `INNER JOIN`; and
* the `groupBy` to the SQL `GROUP` expression.

If you do that you'll see the Slick expression makes sense. But when seeing these kinds of queries in code it may help to simplify by introducing intermediate functions with meaningful names.

There are a few ways to go at simplifying this, but the lowest hanging fruit is that `min` expression inside the `map`.  The issue here is that the `group` pattern is a `Query` of `(MessageTable, UserTable)` as that's our join. That leads to us having to split it further to access the message's timestamp field.

Let's pull that part out as a method:

```scala
import scala.language.higherKinds

def timestampOf[S[_]](group: Query[(MessageTable,UserTable), â†©
                                                (Message,User), S]) =
  group.map { case (msg, user) => msg.ts }
```

What we've done here is introduced a method to work on the group query, using the knowledge of the `Query` type introduced in [The Query and TableQuery Types](#queryTypes) section of Chapter 2.

The query (`group`) is parameterized by the join, the unpacked values, and the container for the results. By container we mean something like `Seq[T]`.  We don't really care what our results go into, but we do care we're working with messages and users.

With this little piece of domain specific language in place, the query becomes:

``` scala
val nicerStats =
   messages.join(users).on(_.senderId === _.id).
   groupBy { case (msg, user)   => user.name }.
   map     { case (name, group) => (name, group.length, timestampOf(group).min) }
```

We think these small changes make code more maintainable and, quite frankly, less scary. It may be marginal in this case, but real world queries can become large. Your team mileage may vary, but if you see Slick queries that are hard to understand, try pulling the query apart into named methods.


<div class="callout callout-info">
**Group By True**

There's a `groupBy { _ => true}` trick you can use where you want to select more than one aggregate from a query.

As an example, have a go at translating this SQL into a Slick query:

``` sql
select min(ts), max(ts) from message where content like '%read%'
```

It's pretty easy to get either `min` or `max`:

``` scala
messages.filter(_.content like "%read%").map(_.ts).min
```

But you want both `min` and `max` in one query. This is where `groupBy { _ => true}` comes into play:

``` scala
messages.filter(_.content like "%read%").groupBy(_ => true).map {
  case (_, msgs) => (msgs.map(_.ts).min, msgs.map(_.ts).max)
}
```

The effect here is to group all rows into the same group! This allows us to reuse the `msgs` collection, and obtain the result we want.
</div>

#### Grouping by Multiple Columns

The result of `groupBy` doesn't need to be a single value: it can be a tuple.  This gives us access to grouping by multiple columns.

We can look at the number of messages per user per room.  Something like this:

```
Vector(
  (Air Lock, HAL,   2),
  (Air Lock, Dave,  2),
  (Pod,      Dave,  2),
  (Pod,      Frank, 2) )
```

That is, we need to group by room and then by user, and finally count the number of rows in each group:

``` scala
val msgsPerRoomPerUser =
   rooms.
   join(messages).on(_.id === _.roomId).
   join(users).on{ case ((room,msg), user) => user.id === msg.senderId }.
   groupBy { case ((room,msg), user)   => (room.title, user.name) }.
   map     { case ((room,user), group) => (room, user, group.length) }.
   sortBy  { case (room, user, group)  => room }
```

Hopefully you're now in a position where you can unpick this:

* We join on messages, room and user to be able to display the room title and user name.
* The value passed into the `groupBy` will be determined by the join.
* The result of the `groupBy` is the columns for the grouping, which is a tuple of the room title and the user's name.
* We select just the columns we want: room, user and the number of rows.
* For fun we've thrown in a `sortBy` to get the results in room order.


## Take Home Points

Slick supports `join`, `joinLeft`, `joinRight`, `joinOuter` and a `zip` join. You can map and filter over these queries as you would other queries with Slick.  Using pattern matching on the query tuples can be more readable than accessing tuples via `._1`, `._2` and so on.

Aggregation methods, such as `length` and `sum`, produce a value from a set of rows.

Rows can be grouped based on an expression supplied to `groupBy`. The result of a grouping expression is a group key and a query defining the group. Use `map`, `filter`, `sortBy` as you would with any query in Slick.

The SQL produced by Slick might not be the SQL you would write.
Slick expects the database query engine to perform optimisation. If you find slow queries, take a look at _Plain SQL_, discussed in the next chapter.



## Exercises

### `HAVING` Many Messages

Modify the `msgsPerUser` query...


~~~ scala
val msgsPerUser =
   messages.join(users).on(_.senderId === _.id).
   groupBy { case (msg, user)  => user.name }.
   map     { case (name, group) => name -> group.length }
~~~

...to return the counts for just those users with more than 2 messages.

<div class="solution">
SQL distinguishes between `WHERE` and `HAVING`. In Slick, you just use `filter`:

~~~ scala
val msgsPerUser =
   messages.join(users).on(_.senderId === _.id).
   groupBy { case (msg, user)  => user.name }.
   map     { case (name, group) => name -> group.length }.
   filter  { case (name, count) => count > 2 }
~~~

Running this on the data in _aggregates.scala_ produces:

~~~ scala
Vector((Dave,4))
~~~
</div>


### User Rooms

In this chapter we saw this query:

~~~ scala
val outer = for {
  (usrs, occ) <- users joinLeft occupants on (_.id === _.userId)
} yield usrs.name -> occ.map(_.roomId)
~~~

It would be nicer if we could find another way to express this so it didn't show rooms users don't occupy.

<div class="solution">
A right join between users and occupants can help us here.
For a row to exist in the occupant table it must have a room:

~~~ scala
val usersRooms = for {
  (usrs,occ) <- users joinRight occupants on (_.id === _.userId)
} yield usrs.name -> occ.roomId
~~~
</div>
