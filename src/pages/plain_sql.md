# Plain SQL {#PlainSQL}

Slick supports plain SQL queries as well as the lifÙè∞Ñted embedded style we've used. Plain queries don't compose as nicely as lifted, but enable you to execute essentially arbitrary SQL when you need to.

## Update


back in [Chapter 2](#Querying)...

The alternative is to use the SQL we original wanted via a _plain SQL query_. This is an alternative to the collections-like style we've used up to this point.  Here's how this update looks as a plain query:

~~~ scala
import scala.slick.jdbc.StaticQuery.interpolation

val query =
  sqlu"""UPDATE "message" SET "content" = CONCAT("content", '!')"""

val numRowsModified = query.first
~~~

`sqlu` is a _[string interoplator][link-scala-interpolation]_ for SQL updates. The `query` we have constructed, just like other queries, is not run until we evaluate it in the context of a session via `first` (or `firstOption`, or `list`, and so on). However, there is a big difference from the other queries we've seen. The type of `query` is `StaticQuery[Unit,Int]`. As the word "static" suggests, these kinds of queries do not compose, other than via a form of string concatenation.

As we are using a string interpolation, we have access to `$` for binding to variables:

~~~ scala
val char = "!"
val query =
  sqlu"""UPDATE "message" SET "content" = CONCAT("content", $char)"""
~~~

This gives us two benefits: the compiler will point out typos in variables names, but also the input is santitized against SQL injection attacks.

We'll look at plain SQL in more depth in chapter 4, including the `sql` interpolator for select statements.


### Exercises

#### Interpolated Variables

Write a method that will take any string, and return a query to append the string to all messages. Use a plain SQL query to do this.

What happens if you try to append special SQL characters, such as `'` (single quote), `"` (double quote), or `;` (semicolon)?

<div class="solution">
~~~ scala
def append(s: String) =
  sqlu"""UPDATE "message" SET "content" = CONCAT("content", $s)"""
~~~

The `$s` interpolation is safely escaped, allowing any unsafe text to be used without risk.
</div>

#### Unsafe Composition

Using, but not modifying, the method from the last exercise, restrict the update to messages from "HAL".

Would it be possible to construct invalid SQL?

<div class="solution">
~~~ scala
def append(s: String) =
  sqlu"""UPDATE "message" SET "content" = CONCAT("content", $s)"""

val halOnly = append("!") + """ WHERE "sender" = 'HAL' """
~~~

It is very easy to get this query wrong and only find out at run-time. Notice, for example, we had to include a space before "WHERE" and use the correct single quoting around "HAL".

A slight improvement on this is to automatically escape values. We can do this by using `+?` to introduce parameters:

~~~ scala
val halOnly = append("!") + """ WHERE "sender" = """ +? "HAL"
~~~

The methods `+` and `+?` are the only `StaticQuery` method for composing queries.

</div>

## Exercises

#### Robert Tables

What will the following do?

~~~ scala
def userByEmail(email:String) = {
    sql"""select * from "user" where "user"."email" = '#${email}'"""
}

val ohDear = userByEmail("""';DROP TABLE "user";--- """).as[User].list

results.foreach(result => println(result))

sql"""select * from "user" """.as[User].list.foreach(result => println(result))
~~~


<div class="solution">
If you are familiar with [joins][link-xkcd],
the title of the exercise has probably tipped you off.
`#$` does not escape input, so the SQL we run is actually two queries:

~~~ sql
SELECT * FROM "user" WHERE "user"."email" = '';
~~~
and

~~~ sql
DROP TABLE "user";---
~~~

When we attempt to return all users from `user`,
the table has been dropped and get we get the error:

~~~
org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Table "user" not found; SQL statement:
select * from "user"  [42102-185]
~~~
</div>


## Take Home Points

- `#$` is incredibly dangerous. Information should always be escaped before it goes near a database. Never forget little bobby tables.
